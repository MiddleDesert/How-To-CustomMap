# Part 1. Making Custom Map

(If You Don't Already Know How To Use Blender Go Do That First!)
Make A Map Of Whatever Kind (Preferrably A Forest Or Only Up) In Blender And Make Sure It Has A Relative Scale Of (10,10,10)
Then For The Materials You Don't Want To Add Textures Just Rename Them To One Of These Names Based On What Kind Of Material You Want https://github.com/MiddleDesert/How-To-CustomMap/blob/main/README.md#materials-names 
After Export The Model As A OBJ And Name It EXACTLY just map.obj
Make Sure It Is Exported To Downloads To Make It Easier To Find!

# Part 2. Sending Custom Map For Review And Verification 

After Exporting
Make A Repository On Github Called Whatever Name You Want Your Map To Be Called.
Import Your map.obj and map.mlt to your Github Repository.
After Post The Link To The Repository(Make Sure Its A Public Repository) In This Discord Server's Channel Called Post-Your-Map-Repos https://discord.gg/wHCW2Aa6fe 
If Your Map Isn't Innapropiate And Is Sized Good Then It Will Eventually Be Put On The Custom Map List Ingame!

# Part 3. Updating Your Map
This is the easiest part as it only requires you making a new map.obj and map.mlt for more info look back on this https://github.com/MiddleDesert/How-To-CustomMap/blob/main/README.md#part-1-making-custom-map 
after your done making a new map delete the old map.obj and map.mlt from your map repository and replace it with the new ones and thats it. Just like that your new map will be updated and shown ingame!
